# Puppr

[Puppr App](https://puppr-client.herokuapp.com)

Puppr is a full-stack app built to connect dog owners to meet for puppy playdates.

## Setup

To get dependencies after cloning:

`npm install`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Technologies

The stack for this project was React, Ruby on Rails, and PostgreSQL database. It is deployed online via Heroku.

## Challenges and Future Plans

This project was very difficult. A large source of that was my desire to cram as much functionality as I could in a week while also trying to gain a deeper understanding of the technologies I chose for the project. 

Some of the biggest struggles came from trying to implement a Profile component in React that would render data specific to the user that was currently logged in. This required setting up authentication and managing state in a way that would not cause the app to break if a user didn't have a dog or as many pictures as another user. 

While this project gave me a lot of reps with working in React, I still have a long ways to go to really understand how to utilize React and React Components in my code properly.
